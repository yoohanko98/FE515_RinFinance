# Question 1: Quantmod package (30 points)

# 1. Download 1 year length data for an equity (You can select any equity you 
# like), set the start time as Jan. 1st, 2018 and end time as Dec 31st, 2018




# 2. Calculate daily return using functions from this package. In this 
# question, you shall calculate both simple return and log return. 
# (The two return sequences will be used in the next question.)

# return sequences will be used in the next question.)

# Question 2: Basic statistics value and self-defined function (20 points)
# In this question, you need to design a self-defined function to calculate 
# the first moment up to the fourth moment for the return sequences you 
# obtained from Question 1. To help you build this function, please following 
# instructions:

# 1. Your input should be a vector. Other than this format, your function 
# should stop working and send the user a warning message.



# 2. Calculate the first moment up to fourth moment for your input.



# 3. The object you want to return should be a “report”, this report should 
# contain values from step 2. Meanwhile, you should tell the user the data 
# is left skew or right skew, heavy tail or short tail.


# =============================================================================
# In Question 1, you are required to generate the Relative Strength Index using
# the function from Quantmod. In this question, you are required to generate 
# this index by yourself without using any package. Please use the same equity 
# data you downloaded in Question 1.

# using the function from Quantmod. In this question, you are required to 
# generate this index by yourself without using any package. Please use the 
# same equity data you downloaded in Question 1.




# 2. Investigate how to calculate the RSI index in detail. Make sure you will 
# have the index value for all trading days between Jan. 1st, 2018 and 
# Dec 31st, 2018. (Hint: you may need extra equity data to replicate the same 
# result as you have in Question 1)




# 3. Based on the index value you get, how many times you observe a strong 
# selling signal (higher than 70)? How many times you observe a strong buying 
# signal? (lower than 30)
